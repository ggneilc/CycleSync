#### Problem Being Addressed

- People around campus or cities tend to not ride bikes simply because they don't have them and don't want to drop the few hundred dollars for one to ride around when they content enough with walking -> it's not a big enough issue for them to do something about it but they would want something better if they could have it. Other people have bikes that they are not riding 24/7, maybe they only have classes in the morning, or only tues/thursday, or maybe the guy in the city has a car or his new workplace is far so he just takes public transportation and no longer uses his bike. 
- The solution is that you would be able to put your bike up for rent to let other people use your bike either for free or rent it out for a price (not sure about monetization) 

#### Description of Project
- What problem are we solving?

	The fact that more people would ride bikes if they had them, and the people who do have bikes aren't riding them 24/7 and would be incentivised to let others borrow them who need them more

- How will we solve it?

	It would either be similar to city bike rack (chicago pay for a bike for a day) or like a ride share ordeal where you create an account as either a vendor or rider, and you can either look for available bikes or put your own bike up for rent to other people. They could either come to the vendor's house to pick it up or we have the city style where there is a designated spot to leave the bike and the vendor would tell them the code for the lock.
